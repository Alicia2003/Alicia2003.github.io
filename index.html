        <p>For this project we were assigned to create a web page that shows a random motivational quote when a button is clicked. We used arrays, math.random() method, jQuery click functions, and the .length method to display different quotes from the array onto the webpage when the button was clicked.  </p>
        <h2><a href="https://alicia2003.github.io/Gossip-Girl-Quiz/">Character Quiz</a></h2>
        <p>For this project we used our skills in jQuery and javascript to create a webpage were users can take a quiz to find out which charcater they are from a tv show. We used else if statements and compound conditionals to display a specific character after certain inputs were put in.   </p>
